This is a modest BomberMan clone I made using SFML library. It's nothing fancy, but working without a game engine was a great learning lesson.

It was developed as an project for a C# programming course in about 3 weeks.

The main challenging aspects where:
  * Working outside a game engine was something I dearly missed. That meant having to make my own game loop or taking care of rendering.
  * Figuring how to work with a grid for the map and bombs/items spawning.
  * Getting right the hability of being able to walk on your own bombs just after drop them.

Though originally composed for another project, music is also my creation.

I'm not sure if I even still remember how to make it run, but you can see a short gameplay here: https://studio.youtube.com/video/QDdUwTdojY4/
