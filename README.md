This is a modest BomberMan clone I made using SFML library. It's nothing fancy, but to work without a game engine meant the challenge of taking care of stuff like the game loop, rendering, or even colliders.

It was developed as an project for a C# programming course.

I'm not sure if I even still remember how to make it run, but you can see a short gameplay here: https://studio.youtube.com/video/QDdUwTdojY4/
